This is a repository for a Python Tkinter program for Educating students on Basic Intellectual Property Rights
Main purpose of this application is to ensure the talents of a bright student mind should not be theft due to his/her negligence in protecting the innovation made by him/her. This protection can be done by Intellectual Property Rights. 
This is a Python Tkinter Application created for school students to educate them about various Intellectual Property Rights based on a story quiz game. This application not only makes students play the quiz because of its unique attention grabbing stories and images but also due to a easy and understandale UI it helps them retain longer on the game and gain knowledge. The application is also integrated with section of Laws provided by Indian government in regard of Intellectual Property Rights and also a section of websites for same information. 
My aim for the project is that I integrate even more stories and more information and make it accessible very easily across all the curriculums. Design the application in such a way that it aligns with school curriculums so that it could be integrated by boards for better knowledge of students.

In this project I have put 12 stories 3 for each. You can easily add more stories and related images to the same.
